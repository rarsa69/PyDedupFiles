As the functionality expands, lines from this file will move to the README.md file


- Combine the search for duplicates and the visual comparison into a single executable
- Identify identical JPEG files even if the EXIF file is different (by using imagemagick identify)
- Identify "similar" files, such as the same image in different sizes (Probably using Imagemagick)
- Allow setting configuration parameters 
  - Indicate how to do the comparison (from fast binary comparison to slower comparisons)
  - Indicate the kind of files to compare
- Show EXIF information along with the file
- Compare other types of files (still deciding how to visually show the identical files)
